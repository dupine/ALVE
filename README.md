## Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate the life and evolution of intelligent entities capable of surviving based on their needs and the surrounding environment. The entire simulation takes place in a 2D top-down environment and includes a legend for specific information and visual references.




## Features

The initial version of the program is a simple random movement simulation. Entities do not have a decision-making system and wander aimlessly. Using a Spatial HashMap algorithm, they can detect nearby food sources within a certain range and move toward them. If they fail to find food within a predefined number of ticks, they die.
